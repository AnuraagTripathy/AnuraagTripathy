### üöÄ **Projects**

**CrediBot** (Python, Flask, Selenium, Langchain, RAG, Pinecone)
- Developed an AI-powered WhatsApp bot to combat misinformation, specifically targeting older demographics.
- Differentiated from traditional fake news checkers by referencing research papers rather than search engine results
or social media posts.
- Engineered a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Pinecone‚Äôs vector database for efficient
fact-checking.
- Utilized LangChain to preprocess and vectorize research papers from the arXiv database, enabling semantic search
for user queries.
- Designed a scalable backend to retrieve, rank, and generate concise, evidence-based responses using LLMs.

**DocReach** (Winner, HopHacks | Next.js, Flask, Pytorch, MongoDB, Git)
- Built a mobile web app to improve healthcare access in rural areas of lower-middle-income countries.
- Developed the frontend using Next.js and the backend using Flask, integrating MongoDB for data storage.
- Implemented NLP techniques to facilitate multimodal communication through text, audio, and images.
- Designed an interactive disease map for epidemic analysis and created a custom disease prediction model to aid
clinical decision-making.

**ResQVision** (Winner, Bitcamp | React.js, Flask, Pytorch, MongoDB, Git)
- Created a web app to enhance disaster response, utilizing a YOLO ML model for optimized rescue operations.
- Built with a YOLO object detection model for survivor identification and Google Maps API for debris mapping.
- Data stored in MongoDB; real-time video processing added for improved functionality.
- Overcame challenges with debris datasets by utilizing the Gemini model for accurate detection.

**CtrlFMyVideo** (Winner, HoyaHacks | React.js, Flask, Pytorch, MongoDB, Git)
- CtrlF My Video revolutionizes video analysis with advanced AI audio recognition.
- Quickly identifies key moments like gunshots and car crashes in large video collections. Making crime detection easier.
- Combines speed and accuracy through a user-friendly interface.
- Makes video analysis faster, easier, and more efficient.
